I love exploring the world, learning new skills, and creating computer programs. During the summer of 2022, I had the pleasure to work at Baycrest Hospital in a summer IT position and I was happy to apply my customer service and scripting skills to support Baycrest staff. Karate and martial arts have been a critical part of my life as I have developed many skills which have provided great value to me through training at Canada's Best Karate. After teaching karate for several years, I am thrilled to witness improvements in their focus and physical abilities while also leading students during exciting activities. Lastly, I have also volunteered at Baycrest Nursing Home in Toronto and I have enjoyed helping Baycrest residents attend different programs while also playing music for them.
